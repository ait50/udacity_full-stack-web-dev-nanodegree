# Lesson 1 - Course Introduction

## 1. Course Overview & Project
instructor: Amy Hua - SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
by the end of this course: implement a database-backed To-Do application
- create, read, updade, and delete to-dos
- create, read, update, and delete lists of to-dos
<br><br>

this project demonstrates: 
- how to *Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)* operations in apps & relational databases
- how to set up *relationships* between lists and to-do items
- how to think about important principles and patterns in building *data models* for a web application
<br>

### Final Project: Fyyur
it's where musical artists can meet musical venues in order for them to find each other

### Non-technical prerequisites
- having the right expectations

    - the point is not to learn "everything" -- it is about scoping clearly what you want to build next. And then, having the foundations and learning strategies for knowing what you'll need to learn to build that next feature, or fix that next bug.
    - being a good software engineer is about being a good beginner -- all, the, time.
    - a [growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means) will greatly help in making this a pleasant journey

- sculpting out the time

    - It helps to schedule and block out a regular time and place to commit to this course to finish it end to end.

- being proactive in your learning
    - getting live feedback in how ready you are to interview for a job with (free) resources like:
        - [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/)
        - [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
    - things less covered in this course:
        - HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        - Application Patterns
        - Algorithms and Data Structures
    - studying in coffee shops and libraries: [coffeetivity](https://coffitivity.com/)
    - [state of flow](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768)
    - [sleep hygiene](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/sleep-hygiene)

- this is a marathon, not a sprint
    - [don't beat yourself up too much for not getting everything right away](https://medium.com/@samyj13/the-most-overused-saying-its-a-marathon-not-a-sprint-776a7103fe66)

## 4. uLab Workspace Overview
Each workspace is a Linux virtual machine with sufficient computing resources running exclusively for you somewhere in the cloud.

All your work is being stored in the ```/home/workspace/``` directory on the virtual machine. 

Any file stored outside it will be deleted after rebooting.

Keep the total contents of the directory to 3GB or less, and don't store any individual files  1.5GB.

You can store logs or checkpoints files in ```/opt/``` directory, however, this too will be deleted once your seession becomes idle.

### Troubleshoot the Workspace
1 - refresh
2 - reset
3 - automated backups
4 - restore a backup
